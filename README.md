# BoxxyAuras

A World of Warcraft addon providing highly customizable display frames for player buffs and debuffs.

## Features

*   **Hold on Hover:** Auras remain visible (don't fade) while your mouse cursor is over the corresponding frame, making tooltips easier to read.

*   **Draggable & Resizable:** Easily move and resize the buff and debuff frames to fit your UI layout.
*   **Configurable Columns:** Set the number of icons wide each frame should display via resize handles.
*   **Customizable Appearance:**
    *   Set individual icon sizes for buffs and debuffs.
    *   Choose Left, Center, or Right alignment for icons within each frame.
*   **Smooth Animations:** Subtle animations play when auras are applied, and when you take damage from a debuff.
*   **Options Panel:** Configure settings easily using the `/ba` or `/boxxyauras` slash commands.

## Usage

*   **Options:** Type `/ba` or `/boxxyauras` in chat to open the options panel.
*   **Reset Frames:** Type `/ba reset` to reset the position and size of the buff and debuff frames to the default top-center location.
